0 !HELP A Technic Flex-System is often seen curved in a model.  In those cases, 
0 !HELP some part of the ends are normally fixed inside another element, while 
0 !HELP the rest is bent.  The part "342.DAT" is meant to model the straight 
0 !HELP parts of the ends.  To achieve this, place one at each end point.  They 
0 !HELP should not be scaled.  The part "343.DAT" is meant to model the rest. 
0 !HELP If it is curved, you would typically scale the "343.DAT" to a have a 
0 !HELP short length, eg. 4LDU, and use many of them along the path of the 
0 !HELP curve. In the example below, the end points are 20LDU length, while the 
0 !HELP centre part of the hose is scaled to have 56LDU length, thus filling out
0 !HELP the rest of the segment.
