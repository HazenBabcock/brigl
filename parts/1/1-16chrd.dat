0 // This file is intentionally empty because at the current \P resolution,
0 // an 1-16chrd is actually empty. However, this file still is present
0 // to allow tools to do primitives substition and fill in a real chrd here,
0 // or, if desired, to substitute this with the hi-res 48\1-16chrd.

0 // This file is based on an idea by Darats at http://forums.ldraw.org/read.php?19,14500,14500#msg-14500
