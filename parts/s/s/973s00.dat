0 !HELP This file dates from times where it was a requirement that certain
0 !HELP colors only get referenced from a subpart file, not a part itself.
0 !HELP At those times, this file had been used to create colored (patterned)
0 !HELP neckmarks on a Minifig torso. That constraint is no longer present. 
0 !HELP Nowadays it is possible for a patterned Minifig Torso to directly use 
0 !HELP a 1-4cyli there.
