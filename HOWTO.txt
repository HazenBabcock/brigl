How to prepare the software
===========================

The software can only run is it is hosted on a server. It will not run
opening the html files on the browser. This is becouse part files are
downloaded asyncronously from the server.

Included is a tiny webserver that you can use in your pc.

1. Download the official library

If you don't already have it, download the official library from:
http://www.ldraw.org/library/updates/complete.zip

Unzip it and copy the content of the subfolder "p" into "parts".
You must merge the folders becouse the program can't try different
directory as desktop software can.

2. (optional) Download the unofficial parts library

Usually models make use of unofficial parts. If you want, you can 
download the unofficial parts library from:

http://www.ldraw.org/library/unofficial/ldrawunf.zip

Unzip the content and merge both "p" and "parts" of unofficial into 
the official "parts". Overwrite when asked.

3. (optional) Subdivide all files in subfolder

The "parts" folder now contains 7000+ files. Many servers and pc
complains about so many files in a single dir, and performances
are degraded.
For any file or subdirectory in "parts", move it in a subfolder starting
with the same name:

a.dat -> a/a.dat
5776.dat -> 5/577a.dat
s/333.dat -> s/s/333.dat
48/1033.dat -> 4/48/1033.dat

If you decide not to subdivide folders, you must pass the option
dontUseSubfolders:true when creating the builder.
