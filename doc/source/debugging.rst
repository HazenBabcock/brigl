Debugging
=========

Basics
------

You start your browser load the URL and nothing happens, or something
happens and nothing is displayed. What to do? One easy way to figure
out what is going wrong is to use the developer tools that provided
by the browser.

* `Chrome <https://developer.chrome.com/devtools>`_

* `Firefox <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools>`_
